<div class="sectionTitle">I am seeking a position as a computer programmer</div>
<hr>

<p> I am currently looking to secure employment with a Capital Region company that will be a creative outlet for my talents as well as allow me to use my skills to benefit the company, the client and my professional growth. My extensive customer relations skills set me apart from other programmers because I am able to work directly with clients at the idea and technical levels.<br><br>

My background in the Healthcare field has allowed me to become very skilled at working with people, one on one, to clarify needs or problems, then educate and support them through to a working resolution. I will bring these skills with me as I transition to working full-time as a computer programmer.<br><br>

I have recently relocated to Upstate NY with my husband, a United States Marine Corps Veteran, now employed as a Crew Chief and helicopter mechanic for the New York State Police, and our four awesome children.
